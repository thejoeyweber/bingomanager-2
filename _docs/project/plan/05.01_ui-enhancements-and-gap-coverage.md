# 05.01 – UI Enhancements & Gaps Coverage

This plan addresses the outstanding front-end UI gaps identified so our application is feature-complete, professional, and consistent. Upon completing these tasks, we will finalize the front-end layer across the entire app.

---

## Overview

We have identified several key areas in which the current UI is incomplete or missing. These include:

1. **Game-Level Advanced Settings & Co-Organizers**  
2. **New “Settings” Tab in `/dashboard/[gameId]/page.tsx`**  
3. **New `/dashboard/settings/account`** for profile and additional details (beyond Clerk defaults)  
4. **Dedicated Session Summary Page** (`/dashboard/[gameId]/sessions/[sessionId]/summary`)  
5. **Manage Subscription** Link to Stripe Customer Portal  
6. **Custom 404 Page**  
7. **Removal of All `todos` References** (template legacy code)  
8. **Revised Dashboard Sidebar Navigation**  
   - Rename “Account Switcher” to “Team Switcher”  
   - Navigation items: My Games, Lists, Reports, Billing, Settings  
   - Remove “Projects” section  
   - User’s account info → link to “Profile,” sign out  
9. **Dashboard Top Navigation/Header**  
10. **Page-by-Page UI Updates** (in-page enhancements for Lists, Card Types, Live Session, Player, Spectator, Reports, etc.)  
    - **Exclude** auth pages (Clerk is sufficient for now)  
11. **Retain `02-core-ui-screens.md`** as archived documentation

---

## Goals

1. **Complete the front-end**: Ensure every page is fully built with the appropriate UI elements, placeholders, and structures for production readiness.
2. **Streamline user experience**: Integrate advanced settings, collaborator management, subscription management, session summaries, and a fully updated dashboard layout and navigation.
3. **Remove legacy code**: Eliminate references to the `todos` starter template to maintain a clean, purposeful codebase.
4. **Use Shadcn UI**: Use Shadcn UI components for everything we're able to. Be careful to not create redundant components. All Shadcn UI components should be in the `@/components/ui` folder. Full inventory of Shadcn UI components can be found in the [components-list.md](../components-list.md) file.

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. Add Game-Level Advanced Settings & Co-Organizers

- **Co-Organizers**  
  - UI for inviting, removing co-organizers from a game.  
  - Possibly a small form or modal inside the new “Settings” tab (see Task 2).  
  - Stub or mock the underlying server logic until fully integrated in future steps.

- **Advanced Settings**  
  - Game visibility (public vs. private), default call mode override, or any additional configuration not covered in the Lists / Card Types tabs.  
  - Present these settings in a straightforward form within the same “Settings” tab.

### 2. Create “Settings” Tab in `/dashboard/[gameId]/page.tsx`

- **New Tab**: “Settings” alongside “Lists,” “Card Types,” and “Generation.”  
- **Contents**:
  1. Co-organizer management (from Task 1).  
  2. Game-level advanced settings.  
  3. Possibly optional advanced toggles, like theme overrides, disclaimers, etc.

### 3. Add `/dashboard/settings/account` Route

- **Purpose**: Display user’s profile details (beyond Clerk defaults) and additional app-specific fields (e.g., membership tier from Drizzle, subscription status, etc.).  
- **UI**: Simple form or read-only page that references the user’s profile in the DB.  
- **Link**: Provide a link to this route in the revised sidebar or top nav (see Task 8).

### 4. Dedicated Session Summary Page

- **Route**: `/dashboard/[gameId]/sessions/[sessionId]/summary`.  
- **UI**:
  - Show called items in chronological order.
  - Show winners, timestamps, any other analytics.  
  - Possibly link to CSV/PDF export or “View full reports” for deeper analytics.  
- **Integration**: Link from the “Live Session” or from a “Reports” index page, if you want a list of past sessions.

### 5. “Manage Subscription” Link

- **Placement**:  
  - Possibly in the “Billing” nav item or in the `/dashboard/settings/account`.  
- **Function**:  
  - Hyperlink to the Stripe Customer Portal (taken from environment vars).  
- **UI**:  
  - A button or link labeled “Manage Subscription” that opens the external Stripe portal.

### 6. Create Custom 404 Page

- **Route**: A standard Next.js `not-found.tsx` or `app/not-found/page.tsx`.  
- **UI**:  
  - Minimal “404 – Page Not Found” message, a link back to `/dashboard` or `/`.

### 7. Remove All `todos` References

- **Tasks**:  
  1. Delete `todos-actions.ts` and any references in `actions/db`.  
  2. Remove the `todos` table from `schema` and `db`.  
  3. Remove any leftover references or imports in the code (e.g., `forceRedirectUrl="/todo"`).  
- **Validation**: Ensure no breaks or side effects in the project after removal.

### 8. Revise Dashboard Sidebar Navigation

- **Rename “Account Switcher”** → “Team Switcher” (already partially done; just confirm).  
- **Navigation Items**:
  1. **My Games** → Direct link to `/dashboard`.  
  2. **Lists** → If needed as a global resource (or omit if it’s strictly per-game).  
  3. **Reports** → `/dashboard/reports` or a new top-level listing.  
  4. **Billing** → Possibly a link to “/dashboard/settings/account#billing” or separate route.  
  5. **Settings** → Could open `/dashboard/settings/account` or a sub-menu.  
- **Remove “Projects” Section**: Unused.  
- **User Info**:
  - Add link to “Profile” → `/dashboard/settings/account`.  
  - Retain sign-out or `UserButton` from Clerk.

### 9. Dashboard Top Navigation/Header

- **New top bar** above the main content:  
  - Display the app’s name/logo or “Bingo Manager.”  
  - Possibly a breadcrumb: “Dashboard / [Game Title] / ...”  
  - Quick actions, e.g., notifications or user menu.  
  - On mobile, the hamburger to toggle sidebar can remain.  
- **Implementation**: In `(dashboard)/layout.tsx`, incorporate a top `<Header>` distinct from the marketing one or repurpose the existing `Header` with a variant style.

### 10. Page-by-Page UI Improvements

For each major page, implement or expand the recommended in-page improvements:

1. **`/dashboard/[gameId]/page.tsx`:**  
   - Add advanced form fields for editing list items (images, reordering, etc.).  
   - Provide color pickers or select menus for card type theming.  
   - Show more robust placeholders in the “Generation” tab (e.g., card previews, email invites).  

2. **Live Session (Caller)**  
   - Option to toggle “manual” vs. “timed” calls.  
   - If items can have images, consider a bigger display of the current call.  
   - More thorough “Claim Bingo” verification UI.  

3. **Player & Spectator**  
   - Distinguish between “called + forcibly marked” vs. “player-chosen marks.”  
   - For spectators, consider a scoreboard or multiple players if relevant.  

4. **Reports**  
   - Possibly show a “Session List” or pick from multiple sessions.  
   - Add more robust placeholders for large data sets.  

**Exclude** authentication pages for now, as Clerk is sufficient.

### 11. Retain `02-core-ui-screens.md` as Archived Reference

- **Action**: Do not delete. Keep it labeled as “Obsolete” or “Superseded” so future contributors can trace the evolution.

---

## Completion Criteria

1. **All new routes** (`/dashboard/settings/account`, `/dashboard/[gameId]/sessions/[sessionId]/summary`, custom 404) and the new “Settings” tab exist with UI stubs or forms.  
2. **Legacy `todos` references removed**; code compiles with no references to “todos.”  
3. **Dashboard sidebar** updated with the new items (My Games, Reports, Billing, Settings) and “Team Switcher” verbiage. “Projects” removed.  
4. **Dashboard top navigation** is implemented consistently.  
5. **Page-by-Page UI enhancements** are in place—particularly game-level advanced settings, co-organizer invites, improved session views, etc.  
6. **Manage Subscription** link is visible and functional.  
7. **Custom 404** page is implemented.  
8. The front-end runs smoothly with no missing or placeholder references and matches the functionality outlined in earlier steps.

Once these tasks are complete, our front-end will be fully covered and ready for final QA before integration or release.

## Implementation Progress
