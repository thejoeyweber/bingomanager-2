# 01 â€“ Frontend Skeleton

## Goals
1. Establish the Next.js structure and routing based on the [Project Instructions](../.cursorrules).
2. Create placeholder pages for:
   - Landing
   - Dashboard
   - Game Creation Wizard (all steps)
   - Live Session (Caller)
   - Player Screen
   - Spectator Screen
   - Reports/Analytics
3. Implement a global layout and basic navigation (header, footer).

## Key Tasks
- Set up `(marketing)` vs. `(auth)` route groups for public landing pages and auth flows.
- Add minimal placeholders for each screen listed in [page-screen-list.md](../page-screen-list.md).
- Configure Shadcn UI and Tailwind according to `.cursorrules`.
- Use Clerk for basic login/sign-up, tested locally.

## Completion Criteria
- All routes exist with placeholders (empty or minimal content).
- Basic header/footer and navigation is in place.
- Project runs locally without errors.
