# 05 â€“ Reports & Analytics

## Goals
1. Implement session summary pages with mock data.
2. Provide CSV/PDF export stubs for session reports.
3. Integrate PostHog (front-end only) to track basic user events.

## Key Tasks
- Build Session Summary UI with a list of calls, winners, and timestamps (all dummy data).
- Implement export buttons for PDF/CSV (dummy or local file generation).
- Insert PostHog tracking calls for critical user actions (wizard completion, live session start, etc.).

## Completion Criteria
- Organizer can open a completed session summary (stub) and see calls/winners.
- Export buttons produce a basic CSV/PDF file (locally faked at this stage).
- Basic PostHog analytics instrumentation is in place (e.g., track page views, button clicks).
