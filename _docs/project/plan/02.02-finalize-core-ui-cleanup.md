# 02.02 – Finalize Core UI (Cleanup)

This plan ensures that we complete all aspects of the updated **02.01** flow (single “Game” page, Lists, Card Types) before moving on to steps 03 and 04.

---

## Goals

1. **Complete List Management UI**  
   - Provide a section (or tab) in the “Game” page where a user can create and manage Lists.  
   - Allow adding/editing/removing individual List Items (text, optional image, mandatory flag).

2. **Complete Card Types UI**  
   - In the “Game” page, enable creating multiple Card Types referencing a chosen List.  
   - Expose fields for `grid_size`, `has_free_space`, `free_space_text`, `color_scheme`, etc.

3. **Enhance Card Generation**  
   - Let the user pick which Card Type they want to generate cards from.  
   - Show the quantity input and any relevant placeholders (e.g. PDF vs. link-based).  
   - (Keep it stubbed in front-end for now; no DB logic required until Step 06.)

4. **Optional Guided Popovers**  
   - If desired, add a simple tooltip or popover “tour” in the “Game” page that walks the user through Lists, Card Types, and Card Generation.

5. **Remove/Archive Obsolete Wizard References**  
   - Clear out or comment any leftover code referencing the old 4-step wizard from the archived `02-core-ui-screens.md` plan.  
   - Make sure the active flow is clearly documented as the single “Game” page approach.

## Tasks

1. **Implement Lists & List Items**  
   - Create a Lists panel or tab in `/dashboard/[gameId]/page.tsx`.  
   - Add UI for viewing, adding, and editing items. Use mock data to maintain consistency until DB integration (Step 06).

2. **Implement Card Types**  
   - In the same “Game” page, create a section for Card Types.  
   - Accept layout/config fields (grid size, free space, color scheme) and display them in a small preview or summary.

3. **Integrate Card Generation with Card Types**  
   - Replace or augment the existing card generation form to ask which Card Type to use.  
   - Continue stubbing any PDF or link generation logic.

4. **Optional Tutorial/Tooltips**  
   - Add popover-based instructions or a small “tour” library, triggered by a help button.  
   - Cover Lists, Card Types, Card Generation, and the final “Start Live Session” step.

5. **Clean Up Wizard Remnants**  
   - Remove references to the old 4-step wizard.  
   - Ensure docs and code references consistently point to the single “Game” page approach.

---

## Completion Criteria

- **Lists and Card Types** appear as distinct UI sections or tabs in the “Game” page.
- **Card Generation** references the user’s chosen Card Type and number of cards.
- Any optional “guided” experience is present (even if minimal).
- No leftover code or docs referencing the obsolete 4-step wizard remain in active use.

Once these tasks are done, we will have a fully realized **02.01** flow and can proceed to **03 (Live Session Interface)** and **04 (Player & Spectator Screens)** with a solid foundation.
