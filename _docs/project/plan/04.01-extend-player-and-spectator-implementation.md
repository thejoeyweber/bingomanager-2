# 04.01 – Extended Player & Spectator Implementation

This mini-plan extends the core Player & Spectator flows from [04-player-and-spectator-screens.md](./04-player-and-spectator-screens.md), focusing on the missing “interactive BingoCardGrid” and real-time spectator display.

---

## Goals

1. **Interactive Grid for Players**  
   - Replace the placeholder list of calls with a functional BingoCardGrid.  
   - Support cell marking, real-time highlighting of called items, and “Claim Bingo” integration.

2. **Spectator Real-Time View**  
   - Display an ongoing feed of called items (or a read-only grid) so spectators can follow the game in real time.

3. **Consistent State & Claim Flow**  
   - Ensure the updated grid logic ties into BingoStore (or any chosen store) so that claims can be accurately triggered and recognized by the Caller screen.

## Key Tasks

1. **Implement BingoCardGrid Component**  
   - Create a new component (or finalize an existing stub) that displays N×N items (server- or client-side).  
   - Highlight items if they have been called, handle “mark” toggles for player interaction.

2. **Integrate BingoCardGrid in Player Page**  
   - Pull the relevant Card Type / “grid size” from mock data (until Step 06 for DB integration).  
   - Maintain a local state for which items are marked, or store that data in BingoStore.  
   - Allow the user to press “Claim Bingo” only if they have a valid pattern (mock check for now).

3. **Enhance the Spectator Page**  
   - Display the current calls either as a call feed or a read-only BingoCardGrid.  
   - Update in real time (mock polling or manual refresh) to show newly called items.

4. **Align Claim Logic**  
   - Hook the player’s “Claim Bingo” action into the store, verifying a stub set of called items.  
   - Ensure the “Caller” interface sees the claim dialog at the correct time (already partially done in BingoStore).

5. **Testing & Validation**  
   - Use local or mock data to test calls, marking, claims, and spectator updates.  
   - Ensure all screens are consistent (Caller, Player, Spectator).

## Completion Criteria

- **Player Screen**: Shows an interactive BingoCardGrid, updates in real time with called items, and supports a functional “Claim Bingo” (at least in stub form).  
- **Spectator Screen**: Displays calls or a read-only grid that reflects the current call state.  
- **Claim Flow**: The claim triggers in BingoStore and is recognized by the Caller screen’s dialog.

Upon finishing these tasks, the project will fully satisfy the success criteria for Step 04, enabling a smooth transition to [05-reports-and-analytics.md](./05-reports-and-analytics.md).
