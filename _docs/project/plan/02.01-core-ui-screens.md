# 02.01 – Core UI Screens (Updated)

This file supersedes the old “02-core-ui-screens.md” by detailing our **new** user flow and UI structure for game creation and setup.

## Goals
1. Use a minimal “New Game” creation form (title + optional description).
2. Provide a **comprehensive “Game” page** for everything else:
   - Lists & List Items.
   - Card Types (layout, grid size, free space, color).
   - Card generation from a chosen Card Type.
3. Optionally offer a guided tour for new users rather than a rigid wizard.

## Key Tasks

1. **Dashboard / New Game Flow**
   - “+ New Game” → small dialog for Title, optional Description.
   - On submit, create draft Game and navigate to `/dashboard/[gameId]/`.

2. **Game Page Layout**
   - **Overview**: Title, description, default call mode, other meta.
   - **Lists**: Display or create new. If new, user can add items (text or image) with possible mandatory flags.
   - **Card Types**: 
     - Reference a chosen List.
     - grid_size, has_free_space, free_space_text, color scheme, override_call_mode, etc.
   - **Generate Cards**:
     - From each Card Type, user can create multiple PDF or link-based cards.
   - **Optional Guided Steps**:
     - Provide help popovers or step-by-step instructions.

3. **Sessions**
   - Possibly show a “Start Session” button leading to the live session interface.

## Completion Criteria
- **Game Page** is functional in the front end (stubbed).
- **Lists** and **Card Types** can be created and edited locally.
- **Card Generation** stubs produce placeholder PDFs or links.
- A guided approach can be toggled by the user.

## Integration with Future Steps
- Next, see **03-live-session-interface.md** for the live caller experience.
- Then, see **06-backend-and-db-integration.md** for DB integration.
