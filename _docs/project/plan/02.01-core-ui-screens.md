# 02.01 – Core UI Screens (Updated)

This file supersedes the old “02-core-ui-screens.md” by detailing our **new** user flow and UI structure for game creation and setup.

---

## What Changed & Why
- **Minimal New Game Creation**: Instead of a 4-step wizard, users create a game with just a Title (required) and Description (optional).  
- **Unified “Game” Page**: All subsequent configuration (Lists, Card Types, etc.) happens on one page, providing more flexibility and reducing user friction.  
- **Guided Steps as Optional**: If a user wants a tutorial, we can offer tooltips or popovers instead of forcing a multi-step wizard.  
- **Clarity with Email/PDF**: We decided to use **SendGrid** (Step 06) for emailing invites and **pdf-lib** (Step 05) for PDF generation to remove any ambiguity.

## Goals
1. Use a minimal “New Game” creation form (title + optional description).
2. Provide a **comprehensive “Game” page** for everything else:
   - Lists & List Items.
   - Card Types (layout, grid size, free space, color).
   - Card generation from a chosen Card Type (PDF or links).
3. Optionally offer a guided tour for new users rather than a rigid wizard.

## Key Tasks

1. **Dashboard / New Game Flow**
   - “+ New Game” → small dialog for Title, optional Description.
   - On submit, create Draft Game and navigate to `/dashboard/[gameId]/`.

2. **Game Page Layout**
   - **Overview**: Title, description, default call mode, etc.
   - **Lists**: Display or create new. Add items (text or image), mark mandatory if needed.
   - **Card Types**: 
     - Reference a chosen List.
     - grid_size, has_free_space, free_space_text, color scheme, override_call_mode, etc.
   - **Generate Cards**:
     - From each Card Type, user can create multiple PDF or link-based cards.
     - PDF generated via **pdf-lib** in Step 05.
     - Invites by email via **SendGrid** in Step 06.
   - **Optional Guided Steps**:
     - Provide help popovers or step-by-step instructions if user opts in.

3. **Sessions**
   - Possibly show a “Start Session” button leading to the live session interface (described in [03-live-session-interface.md](./03-live-session-interface.md)).

## Completion Criteria
- **Game Page** is functional in the front end (stubbed).
- **Lists** and **Card Types** can be created and edited locally (mock data).
- **Card Generation** stubs produce placeholder PDFs or links (until Step 05).
- A guided approach can be toggled by the user.

## Integration with Future Steps
- Next, see [03-live-session-interface.md](./03-live-session-interface.md) for the live caller experience.
- Real DB integration begins at [06-backend-and-db-integration.md](./06-backend-and-db-integration.md).
