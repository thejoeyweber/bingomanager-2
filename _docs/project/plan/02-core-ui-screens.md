# 02 – Core UI Screens

## Goals
1. Flesh out UI for the main screens using stubbed data (no real DB integration).
2. Apply styling and layout decisions from [components-list.md](../components-list.md).
3. Implement the four-step Game Creation Wizard in a functional (but data-stubbed) manner.

## Key Tasks
- Build the “Create New Game” wizard screens (Steps 1–4).
- Add the full UI for the Dashboard list of games (with mock data).
- Create the Game Overview page with card generation config UI (stubs).
- Ensure each page matches the detailed specs in [page-screen-list.md](../page-screen-list.md).

## Completion Criteria
- Users can navigate from Dashboard to the wizard and back, with all wizard steps functional in front-end only.
- The Game Overview page displays placeholder data and allows “card generation” (stubbed).
- UI elements (colors, forms, spacing) adhere to Tailwind + Shadcn guidelines.
