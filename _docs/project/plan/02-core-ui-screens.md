# 02 – Core UI Screens (Archived/Obsolete)

> **ARCHIVED / OBSOLETE**  
> This file previously described a 4-step “Create New Game” wizard. We have fully adopted the single-page approach in [02.01-core-ui-screens.md](./02.01-core-ui-screens.md) and [02.02-finalize-core-ui-cleanup.md](./02.02-finalize-core-ui-cleanup.md).

**Note**: All references to the old wizard flow are removed; use the single “Game” page approach described in the updated docs.
