# 02 – Core UI Screens (Archived/Outdated)

> **ARCHIVED / OUTDATED**  
> This file describes the **original** plan for a 4-step “Create New Game” wizard.  
> **It is kept solely for historical reference** and is superseded by [02.01-core-ui-screens.md](./02.01-core-ui-screens.md), which contains the current, minimal “New Game” approach and a single Game page layout.

## Goals (Original)
1. Flesh out UI for main screens with stubbed data.
2. Implement the four-step Game Creation Wizard (Steps 1–4).

## Key Tasks
- Build “Create New Game” wizard screens (Steps 1–4).
- Add the Dashboard list of games (mock data).
- Create the old Game Overview page with config UI (stubs).
- Match the specs in [page-screen-list.md](../page-screen-list.md).

## Completion Criteria
- Wizard steps fully functional in front-end only.
- Game Overview shows placeholder data, allows stubbed card generation.
- UI elements follow Tailwind + Shadcn guidelines.
