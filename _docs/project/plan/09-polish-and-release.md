# 09 â€“ Polish & Release

## Goals
1. Perform final QA across all flows, ensuring no missing edge cases.
2. Add final branding polish and accessibility checks (WCAG compliance).
3. Deploy to production (Vercel) with correct environment variables.

## Key Tasks
- Resolve any UI/UX glitches or incomplete edge cases found in testing.
- Verify accessibility features: high contrast mode, text-to-speech settings, keyboard nav.
- Configure production environment variables in `.env.local` or Vercel secrets.
- Deploy and validate in real usage scenarios.

## Completion Criteria
- The app is fully functional, accessible, and performs well in production on Vercel.
- All original requirements in [functionality-requirements.md](../functionality-requirements.md) are confirmed complete.
- A final release version is tagged in Git and documented in the README.
